# Description 

Media are frequently treated as means in the business of making records. They help to verify communication occurred. *Did you get my message?* They also help to confirm meaning. *Do you understand it?* Such treatments tend to economize experience. Media should, for instance, facilitate the seizure and extraction of information. *Take a video. Capture some audio. Grab an image before it's gone.* They should function as proof. *I saw this. I heard that. I was there.* They should be efficient. *Give me the tl;dr.* They should secure consensus. *Don't you agree?* And they should accumulate and produce value. *Am I on brand?* 

This seminar accounts for the records business to move beyond it. That move is called "media aesthetics." Step one is speculation, and step two is attending to an apparatus&mdash;from economical communication to possible communications to how we even communicate. If economical communication verifies occurrence and confirms understanding, then speculation operates in the subjunctive. *What if communication were something else?* Here, resistance, refusal, storytelling, and figurative language become potential alternatives to economized experience, as each may brush against the desire for efficiency. An apparatus prompts us to consider why and how. It joins the economical with the subjunctive by producing relations between them. An apparatus is not some underlying structure or ideal form. It's an agent for content and design, and it's often right in front us, like an interface&mdash;there, yet impossible to grasp. During seminar, I'll suggest that the key ingredients of an apparatus are *measurement, movement, sense, and making sense*, and we'll assess how apparatuses discipline and standardize experience while affording experimentation and speculation. We'll examine five apparatuses in particular (grids, editors, networks, stacks, and engines), though we'll need something to ground us and all our abstractions.  

What else but fiction to put us on the same page? We'll study media through discussions of radio dramas, fantasy, science fiction, comics, games, and experimental literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Call it escapism, if you wish; however, these fictions will be quite useful for understanding apparatuses and the economization of experience today. For one, they will nudge us to listen, watch, see, and play as well as read. They will also position audio, image, and text as *congealed labour*: processes and techniques rather than objects and instruments. From this position, we'll approach aesthetics as a question of embodied perception and sensation, and we'll talk about how some experiences of fiction are singular and others are shared. Fiction will also be a site for speculation and worldbuilding, and for stressing why both the content and design of the subjunctive matter. We'll ask what audio, image, and text mean and verify in fiction, but also what they do and, if you're so inclined, what they want. Perhaps most important, we'll consider aesthetics and politics together. How and under what assumptions are media and fiction categorized? How do media encourage and even rationalize particular ways of engaging fiction? How do we compose with, against, and even beyond the apparatuses that dominate cultural production? 

This is not a technical course. The assignments are open to media practice (such as the composition of audio and video) without requiring it. The seminar does not involve any quantitative or computational methods, either. By "media," I mean "audio, image, and text," not "the media" or mass communications and their outlets. And by "media aesthetics," I mean the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced. In this case, we'll evaluate the design and content of fiction.  

# Aims 

This seminar is an opportunity for us to attend to how: 

* Media are things and processes rather than "withdrawn" objects, resources on reserve, instruments of control, or purely subjective experiences. 
* Media are entwined with discipline and experimentation and therefore prompt important questions about the viability of not only critical distance but also romantic (or individualist) creativity.  
* Media and fiction are embodied social relations, not causes, effects, means, or autonomous works or structures. 
* Content and context have agency; fiction and history are not messages merely contained or transmitted by media.  
* Materials and experience have agency, too, hence the relevance of design to media and fiction.      
* Dichotomies such as analogue/digital, print/electronic, and static/interactive tend to be problematic categorizations of media and fiction. 
* Media and fiction morph together over time, with effects on how we define periods (modernism and postmodernism, for example). 
* We communicate and speculate both with and through media and fiction. 

The seminar contributes to your graduate education in English and/or Cultural, Social, and Political Thought by asking you to: 

* Watch, see, read, play, and listen to assigned materials. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice multimodal and comparative approaches to media and fiction. 
* Design a seminar project or essay with feedback from your peers and me. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice planning, drafting, and revising short- and long-form communications.  
* Compose a seminar project or essay, supported by an annotated bibliography and genealogy, on a topic relevant to media aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice making, supporting, expressing, and refining a long-form argument with a particular audience in mind.
* Present a seminar project or essay on a topic relevant to media aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice giving talks and participating in question-and-answer sessions. 
* Co-facilitate (with your peers and me) seminar discussions about assigned topics and materials. Here, my aim here is to create a space for you to practice sparking and sustaining conversations about media and fiction. 

I hope this approach to the seminar offers you room to experiment with your own take on media aesthetics. If you find that it does not, then please let me know, and I'll adjust my approach accordingly.  

# Background 

My name is Jentery Sayers. I’m an associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT), and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I did my PhD at the University of Washington. Most of my work is in comparative media studies. I teach American fiction, cultural studies, media, materialism, and prototyping at UVic. 

I designed this course to correspond with similar research and teaching efforts in UVic's Department of English, including work in literary studies, but also textual studies, book history, and film studies, where questions of mediation are central to scholarly analysis. As part of the CSPT concentration, this course is also an attempt to enact theory, such as posthumanist and (new) materialist theories, in studies of media and fiction. One result of this attempt is less emphasis on distinct media and formats (such as books and film) and more attention to how media work across genres, experiments, and categories, hence the use of "media aesthetics" in the title instead of, say, "electronic literature," "interactive fiction," "audio fiction," "games," or "graphic novels," each of which admittedly warrants a course unto itself. Finally, this seminar builds on previous "prototyping" seminars I've taught at UVic and is meant to serve a rather practical function by offering opportunities for you to approach material across modes (listening, seeing, playing, watching, and reading) and to iteratively develop a project or essay that aligns with your own interests in media aesthetics. This project or essay may speak primarily to academic audiences, or it may have a non- or para-academic context in mind. 

Whatever your ultimate approach, the location of this seminar at UVic is key. The Department of English includes options for graduate students to complete MA essays *or* MA projects, and the university as a whole has a rich history of engaging media, broadly understood. From Special Collections to the Digital Scholarship Commons, you should have a chance to integrate your work with what's happening elsewhere on campus. This seminar and its background aim to prepare you for such integration by presenting you with *a framework for media praxis* as it pertains to fiction in particular and communication in general. Perhaps, for you, praxis leans toward theory, technique, narrative, history, design, or . . . I'm thus excited to see what you do with the framework and how you change and redirect it.

# Structure 

The first week of this seminar is intended mostly for introductions. We'll meet each other, and I’ll review the syllabus and speak to the point of the course. Then we'll talk about media aesthetics and survey what we're studying this term. I'll conclude by sharing with you some relevant methods for approaching media and fiction. 

After Week 1, most weeks will include one or two modules organized around key issues in media aesthetics and communication. I’ll express those issues through questions or remarks that we might often hear or read. For example:

* "Did You Get My Message?" (a module on messengers, curation, and relating with others)
* "Who's Calling?" (a module on broadcasting, decoding, and colonial dissemination)
* "Is Anyone Listening?" (a module on acousmatic voices, gaslighting, and shouting into the abyss)
* "You Already Said That." (a module on memory, playback, and emotional rapport with machines)
* "Property of . . ." (a module on graphic diaries, cross-hatching, and true stories that never happened)
* "Click Here." (a module on links, forks, and portals)
* "I’d Prefer Not To." (a module on menus, refusal, and the design of encounters)

Each module corresponds with a particular work of fiction that will serve as a case study or "tutor text," if you will. 

The middle of the term (immediately after reading break) is dedicated to composing (or arguing) with and through media as a form of scholarship. I'll detail some approaches, and we'll look at some examples by scholars of media and fiction.

The end of the term is dedicated to your presentations (penultimate meeting) and workshopping your projects (last meeting). We'll also recap the seminar and our discussions of media aesthetics during the last meeting. Somewhere between the middle and the end, I'll ask you to meet with me to discuss your final project or essay. I'll give you two weeks after our last meeting to finalize and submit your project or essay.

Please purchase Alison Bechdel's [*Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/). It should be at the UVic Bookstore. 

I recommend purchasing the following: 

* Emil Ferris's [*My Favorite Thing Is Monsters*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters/) (also at the UVic Bookstore)   
* N.K. Jemisin's [*The Fifth Season*](https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/) 
* Toby Fox and Temmie Chang's [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/) 
* Fulbright's [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.game/) 

Of note, you can play *Gone Home* and *Undertale* with friends and watch gameplay videos of them online.  

Alongside these materials, I've dedicated a section of this syllabus to [notes](#notes). I'll populate that section as the term unfolds. I don't plan to use slides during seminar; however, I will include in our discussions various snippets of audio, image, and text from assigned fictions. As you study them, I recommend doing the same: consider screengrabs, sound clips, photographs, video, and whatnot for your own records and reference. If you'd like advice on archiving and annotating media, then let me know.  

You'll notice that most of the assigned materials are from the 21st century. I made these selections in part because I think (or hope) they will spark some engaging, if not pressing, seminar discussions about speculation and the apparatuses of media and fiction; however, we'll still account for history in this course. For instance, during most modules I'll provide overviews of where the assigned materials "fit," and how, in media, fiction, and theory since 1900. I should also mention that my selections reflect an investment in narrative and storytelling. I did not include, for example, any artist's books or poetry, both of which are obviously relevant to studies of media and literature.  

# Schedule 

Here's the schedule for the term. I will notify you during seminar at least two weeks in advance of any changes. When materials are not open access or in the public domain, I abide by fair dealing guidelines. I also contributed to the artists' Patreon accounts, where applicable. 

To keep us on schedule, expect an email from me to everyone in the seminar once (and only once) per week. That weekly email should also encourage transparency and help us all plan ahead. I will often include lesson plans in my emails.

# Notes 

As the term unfolds, I will share in this section my notes and reflections. Expect new content here almost every week of seminar.  

### Definitions

From our first meeting (January 9th), here are some definitions of key terms I'm using to engage media and fiction. After "media" and "fiction," they are alphabetized.   
 
* **Fiction**: a work of audio, image, and/or text that imagines, if only in part, its character(s), world(s), and/or events(s); has a story that's arranged with narrative; may be read, watched, played, seen, and/or heard
* **Media**: congealed labour or techniques made durable; not "the media" (singular) or "mass media" of the communications industry; three primary examples in this course are audio, image, and text 
* **Apparatus**: a mechanism used to measure media and fiction and also economize people's experiences; examples in this course include editors, grids, engines, stacks, and networks 
* **Audio**: a congealed way of hearing and composing; at once process and thing                          
* **Format**: a way to nest, circulate, or store media; examples include novels, comics, games, and radio            
* **Genre**: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of engaging fiction; classic examples are tragedy or comedy, but other examples include fantasy, science fiction, detective, slapstick, romance, action, adventure, horror, mystery, simulation, role-playing, and suspense     
* **Image**: a congealed way of seeing and composing; at once process and thing
* **Labour**: what congeals in media but cannot be recorded completely by it; the activities people individually and collectively perform to produce work; examples include emotional, mental, physical, sensual, manual, and machine labour  
* **Narrative**: how the story in a work of fiction is structured and arranged; components include setup, focalization, character development, and the uses of narrators, flashbacks, and sequencing 
* **Norms**: worldviews that fiction and media both reproduce and resist; ideologies that discipline perception, the production of knowledge, and social and cultural practice; necessarily exclude some ways of hearing, seeing, reading, and composing in favour of other ways   
* **Play**: a negotiation or experiment with the meanings, materials, and modes of media and fiction; need not involve explicit rules; also the primary way of engaging games
* **Prototype**: a possibility presented through media and fiction; associated terms include sketch, scenario, wireframe, experiment, and draft; not a real or finished product with a brand; usually doesn't involve post-production   
* **Story**: the setting(s), plot, character(s), conflict(s), and point(s) of view in a work of fiction
* **Style**: what people say is unique about how a given person or group composes with audio, images, and/or text; an artist's or author's "signature"   
* **Technology**: a system, such as phonography, photography, print, and computing, that reproduces media; usually involves automation  
* **Text**: a congealed way of reading and composing; at once process and thing   
* **Work**: an output or result of labour, such as a work of fiction; not just an object or thing, but its content, apparatus, and the processes that went into making and circulating it 

Again, these definitions are not exhaustive. I'm providing them to render transparent my own assumptions and approaches. Equally important, definitions are often quite fuzzy or contingent with history and culture. They are more like guides for situations than answers to important questions, and they should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. What's missing from them? What do people want from them? What makes them work? I thus hope you'll question and revise these definitions rather than adopting them wholesale for deployment in this seminar or elsewhere.  

### Why Media?

What is the point of studying media and fiction together in the 2020s? Consider the following list, introduced during our first meeting (January 9th). It translates how this seminar applies generally to the practice of communication and specifically to its analytical, structural, social, cultural, and practical dimensions. None of these applications is restricted to the academy. 

Approaching media and fiction together attends to matters of: 

* **Situation**, or the *context of communication*, including how, when, and where people relate and collaborate through particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Composition**, or the *content of communication*, including what people read, see, hear, watch, and play in particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Audience**, or the *purpose of communication*, including what people need, want, and/or expect from particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Norms**, or the *values of communication*, including what people deem to be credible, compelling, biased, predictable, or problematic about particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Novelty**, or the *uniqueness of communication*, including how and why particular media and/or fiction are considered to be innovative, disruptive, experimental, or generic. 
* **Engagement**, or the *experience of communication*, including what people feel and remember about particular media and/or fiction. 
* **Design**, or the *interface of communication*, including what people notice and ignore and how they navigate content and context. 

I use the acronym **SCANNED** (I know, I know . . .) to remember this list and to state succinctly why people might approach media and fiction together.

### The 20 M's

"Media aesthetics" is the framework we'll use to approach media and fiction in this seminar. I define it as *the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced*. 

We'll use 20 words starting with the letter "m" to facilitate our study of media and fiction through media aesthetics. The list, which I shared during our first meeting (January 9th), is a guide, not a set of instructions, and will inevitably fall apart with some practice and pressure. In the list I avoid common dichotomies between mind and body, logic and feeling, and analysis and experience, mostly because such dichotomies are driven by norms or ideals frequently critiqued within media and literary studies. Although there's an order to the outline, with "Apprehension" appearing first, it's not a hierarchy or series of steps. The "Evaluation" section may prompt revisions to "Synthesis," for example, or some people may wish to start with "Comprehension." I use "work" throughout the guide to refer to a work of fiction and its media (audio, image, and text), and I encourage repeated description to render the process as approachable as possible. Suggestions welcome.  

**Apprehension** 

"What's happening here?" Apprehension is about impressions, sensations, and evocations. It's about the moment, which may be familiar. "I've felt this before." While experience may feel personal, it's social, too. It's structured by media and fiction, and it's shaped by design.   

* Describe the *materials* used. 
* Describe the *modes* or senses engaged. 
* Describe the *mood* inhabited or experienced. 

Consider recording or annotating your (initial) engagement in real time (like an unboxing video or Let's Play), if only for your own records. With express consent, you might do the same for someone else and then compare your results. Account for eye rolls and anxious feelings as well: what's off-putting, predictable, unclear, discomfiting, frustrating . . . Apprehension isn't necessarily appreciation.   

**Comprehension** 

"What's this about?" Comprehension is about expressions, understanding, and situating things. It's about making sense after the fact&mdash;identifying and arranging the parts. While it may feel impersonal, it's nevertheless motivated. People usually want meaning and even purpose from media and fiction. 

* Describe the *modules* or parts of the work. 
* Describe the units used to *measure* the work and its parts.  
* Describe the *main content* of the story (who, what, when, and where).
* Describe the work's history, its network, and its *moment* of composition (who, what, when, and where). 

Consider distilling the work, reflecting on it, and even graphing its parts, story, and/or relation to other works in its network. Note how and when these practices are about control, or the pleasure of making sense of things. When is control problematic? What do graphs or classifications get wrong? 

**Synthesis** 

"How does it all come together?" Synthesis is about boundaries and relations. It entwines apprehension with comprehension. It connects materials with abstractions and personal experiences with structures and designs. It's never total or complete; it can't and shouldn't account for all the things.  

* Describe how (you assume) the work was *made*. 
* Get *meta*. Describe how the story is told.
* Describe what the work *means* (or its multiple, incongruous *meanings*). 
* Describe how it *massages* or *manipulates* people's senses.
* Describe how people *move* with, within, across, and beyond it. 
* Describe what *motivates* people to return to and/or identify with it. 
* Describe how it and responses to it have *morphed* over time. 
* Describe how it is or would be collected and *maintained* over time. 

Consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. Otherwise, the process may be overwhelming. 

**Evaluation** 

"So what?" Evaluation is about assessment, or why people should care about the work and engagements with it. Evaluations have intended audiences; knowing that audience and their expectations focuses the inquiry. 

* Describe how the work *mediates* its relation to power and "common sense" (norms, assumed knowledge, and congealed ways of perceiving). 
* Describe who and what it *misses*, ignores, or essentializes.  
* Describe the *memories* it elicits and how it elicits them. 
* Describe how it functions as *mimesis* (show, drama) and diegesis (tell, narrative) within and against its network.  

Again, consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. A response may not be an essay or series of paragraphs. Compose with audio, image, and/or text to determine what sticks with you and/or what others deem to be most compelling.  

**Action** 

"What to do about it all?" Action is about learning and intervention: what people do with a work of media and fiction they encounter and study. Perhaps they do nothing with it. Preferring not to is indeed a sort of action. But so are improving the work, responding to it, integrating it into a project, discussing it with others, and drawing motivation from it. "Active learning" assumes many forms.  

* *Mobilize* the work: change it, prototype with it, teach it, critique it, exhibit it, write about it. 

Consider how a given work of media and fiction intersects with your own interests and trajectories and then determine how to communicate these intersections to (or with) other people. 

### Apparatuses

Approaches to media in fiction rely heavily on how media are measured: how they are divided into components and then isolated, traversed, compared, contrasted, and the like. These components are not the inevitable output of technologies. They are decisions with histories, norms, and expectations. That is, they are made and used often, they have conventions, and people want or assume particular experiences from them. They are also entwined with disciplines and discourses, such as how people talk about games, comics, radio, and books. A mechanism for the production of these components may be called an "apparatus."

An apparatus is not exactly a form or template. It's a relation machine. It helps people to sense and make sense of media in fiction&mdash;to measure media, build vocabularies for media, and move between, within, across, beyond, and to media.

Here's a list of five apparatuses at play in this seminar. I shared it during our first meeting (January 9th). After each apparatus, I mention some components they produce and some relations they enable. I imagine a few of the terms may be unfamiliar, so we'll discuss them during the term. 

* **The Grid**: produces panels and gutters in comics; columns, margins, headers, and lexia on pages; and snap guides in design software; relations premised on flatness, surface, sequence, syntax, scanning, and juxtaposition
* **The Stack**: produces a front end and back end as well as presentation, logic, and database layers; relations premised on depth, dependencies, access, and visibility 
* **The Network**: produces paths, maps, branches, and nodes; relations premised on links, forks, paradigms, and wandering 
* **The Editor**: produces tracks, segments, fades, cuts, splices, wipes, and effects; relations premised on ellipsis, sequence, condensing, synchronization, and simultaneity 
* **The Engine**: produces worlds, theatres, and models; relations premised on programming, simulation, immersion, and immediacy  

These apparatuses of course intersect. Any given web project, for instance, may involve all of them. Equally interesting, an apparatus may not be explicit in people's engagements with media. The lines of a grid or the graphs for a network rarely appear on page or screen, and an engine usually wants people to forget they're inside a program or world. An apparatus is thus more like an interface. It's there, with palpable consequences; it's just not tangible or tactile.   

An apparatus has clear implications for design, yet it's relevant to studies of fiction, too. If an apparatus is a relation machine, then those relations likely congeal with repeated and collocated use, understood in fiction as genre. Here's another list, then. It uses prepositions to mark relations enabled by apparatuses and then experiments with those prepositions to describe components and experiences common in particular genres, which I italicize. 

* **At (spectacle)**: privileges the coherence of audio, image, and/or text into a single presentation; the story matters less than the experience; spectacles are common in *action and adventure*   
* **Within (worldbuilding)**: privileges the configuration of audio, image, and/or text as components in a system with rules or conventions; a story is played or inhabited; worldbuilding is common in *fantasy, science fiction, and roleplaying*        
* **Between (texture)**: privileges friction or tension between components of audio, image, and/or text; a story emerges from play or ambiguity and may promise resolution; texture is common in *strategy, comedy, and detective fiction*   
* **Across (deferral)**: privileges the use of audio, image, and/or text to make promises and then postpone delivery; the story thrives on what is or could be next; deferral is common in *mystery, horror, thrillers, and suspense*   
* **Beyond (epic)**: privileges pointing to audio, image, and/or text found elsewhere; the story is part of and refers to something larger; epic is common in *sagas, encyclopedic fiction, and historical fiction* 
* **To (address)**: privileges interpellation (hey you!) or identification (it me!) via components of audio, image, and/or text; address is common in *simulation and coming-of-age fiction*    

These aren't recipes for genres, and this isn't an exercise in totalization (as if one list could capture everything about genre). It's simply a starting point for approaching media in fiction through an apparatus. I return to the notion of genre later in this course. For now, I'll repeat here my definition of it: "genre: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of engaging fiction." The apparatus of media, or how they're measured, shapes these conventions and expectations.  

# Policies 

### Prerequisites 

There are no prerequisites for this seminar. It is part of the English graduate program (MA and PhD) and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought concentration (MA and PhD). It's a special topics course (English 506, Studies in Literary Theory: Special Topic).
  
### Assessment 

The genealogy and final project or essay are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these two assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

I will use the Faculty of Graduate Studies' [official grading system](https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2020-01/grad/academic-regulations/grading.html) to produce rubrics for each assignment and assess your work. I do not post marks outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism detection software.

### Late Submissions and Extensions

If you need to request an extension or you're concerned about the possibility of a late submission, then please email me. I recommend that you do not fall behind on any assignment, if possible, but I understand that extensions may be necessary for numerous reasons. I will comment on all assigned work I receive from you during the term, regardless of when it's submitted.   

### Communications 

The best way to communicate with me is in person, either by appointment or during my office hours, which are Mondays, 1-3pm, in CLE D334. You are also welcome to email me at jentery@uvic.ca. I respond to work email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  

I'm asking you to meet with me at least once outside of seminar this term. We'll take 20-30 minutes to discuss your final project or essay.  

### Feedback 

I will provide feedback by email on each assignment. Feedback on your co-facilitations may be bundled with feedback on other assignments, such as the bibliography and genealogy.  

Throughout the term, I'll request feedback (verbal and in writing) from you on how the seminar is going. I'll also ask you to complete Course Experience Surveys at the end of the term (during our last meeting). 

### Attendance and Participation

Weekly attendance in graduate seminars is expected. If you must miss a meeting, then please notify me ahead of time by email. Cases of continuous, unexplained absence may result in your ineligibility to complete the course. Attendance and active participation in discussions and workshops are part of fulfilling the course requirements. I will notify the Graduate Adviser if you have three or more unwarranted absences.
