## Description 

Media are frequently treated as means in the business of making records. They help people to verify communication occurred. *Did you get my message?* They also help people to confirm meaning. *Do you understand it?* Such treatments tend to economize experience. Media should, for instance, facilitate seizure and extraction. *Take a video. Capture some audio. Grab the image before it's gone.* They should function as proof. *I saw this. I heard that. I was there.* They should be efficient. *Give me the tl;dr.* They should secure consensus. *Don't you agree?* And they should accumulate and produce value. *Am I on brand?* 

This seminar accounts for the records business to move beyond it. That move is called "media aesthetics." Step one is speculation, and step two is attending to an apparatus&mdash;from economical communication to possible communications to how we even communicate. If economical communication verifies occurrence and confirms understanding, then speculation operates in the subjunctive. *What if communication were something else?* Here, imagination, poetics, resistance, and refusal become alternatives to economized experience, as each brushes against the desire for efficiency. An apparatus helps us to understand why and how. It joins the economical with the subjunctive by producing relations between them. An apparatus is not some underlying structure or ideal form. It's an agent for content and design, and it's often right in front us, like an interface&mdash;there, yet impossible to grasp. During seminar, I'll suggest that the key ingredients of an apparatus are *measurement, movement, sense, and making sense*, and we'll discuss how apparatuses discipline and standardize experience while affording experimentation and speculation. We'll consider five apparatuses in particular (grids, editors, networks, stacks, and engines); however, we'll need something to ground us and all the abstractions.
