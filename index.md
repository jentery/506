## Description 

Media are frequently treated as means in the business of making records. They help people to verify communication occurred. *Did you get my message?* They also help people to confirm meaning. *Do you understand it?* Such treatments tend to economize experience. Media should, for instance, facilitate seizure and extraction. *Take a video. Capture some audio. Grab the image before it's gone.* They should function as proof. *I saw this. I heard that. I was there.* They should be efficient. *Give me the tl;dr.* They should secure consensus. *Don't you agree?* And they should accumulate and produce value. *Am I on brand?* 

This seminar accounts for the records business to move beyond it. That move is called "media aesthetics." Step one is speculation, and step two is attending to an apparatus&mdash;from economical communication to possible communications to how we even communicate. If economical communication verifies occurrence and confirms understanding, then speculation operates in the subjunctive. *What if communication were something else?* Here, imagination, poetics, resistance, and refusal become alternatives to economized experience, as each may brush against the desire for efficiency. An apparatus helps us to understand why and how. It joins the economical with the subjunctive by producing relations between them. An apparatus is not some underlying structure or ideal form. It's an agent for content and design, and it's often right in front us, like an interface&mdash;there, yet impossible to grasp. During seminar, I'll suggest that the key ingredients of an apparatus are *measurement, movement, sense, and making sense*, and we'll discuss how apparatuses discipline and standardize experience while affording experimentation and speculation. We'll consider five apparatuses in particular (grids, editors, networks, stacks, and engines), though we'll need something to ground us and all the abstractions.  

What else but fiction to put us on the same page? We'll study media through discussions of radio dramas, fantasy, science fiction, comics, games, and experimental literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Call it escapism, if you wish; however, these fictions will be quite useful for understanding capitalism and the economization of experience today. For one, they will prompt us to listen, watch, see, and play as well as read. They will also position audio, image, and text as *congealed labour*: processes and techniques rather than objects and instruments. From this position, we'll approach aesthetics as a question of embodied perception and sensation, and we'll examine how some experiences of fiction are singular and some are shared. Fiction will also be a site for speculation and worldbuilding, and for stressing why both the content and design of the subjunctive matter. We'll ask what audio, image, and text mean and verify in fiction, but also what they do and, if you're so inclined, what they want. Perhaps most important, we'll consider aesthetics and politics together. How and under what assumptions are experiences of media and fiction categorized? How do media encourage and even rationalize particular ways of engaging fiction? How do we compose with, against, and even beyond the apparatuses that dominate cultural production? 

This is not a technical course. It's open to media practice (such as the composition of audio and video) without requiring it. The course does not involve any quantitative methods, either; and, by "media," I mean "audio, image, and text," not "the media" or mass communications and its outlets.
