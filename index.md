## Description 

Media are frequently treated as means in the business of making records. They help to verify communication occurred. *Did you get my message?* They also help to confirm meaning. *Do you understand it?* Such treatments tend to economize experience. Media should, for instance, facilitate the seizure and extraction of information. *Take a video. Capture some audio. Grab the image before it's gone.* They should function as proof. *I saw this. I heard that. I was there.* They should be efficient. *Give me the tl;dr.* They should secure consensus. *Don't you agree?* And they should accumulate and produce value. *Am I on brand?* 

This seminar accounts for the records business to move beyond it. That move is called "media aesthetics." Step one is speculation, and step two is attending to an apparatus&mdash;from economical communication to possible communications to how we even communicate. If economical communication verifies occurrence and confirms understanding, then speculation operates in the subjunctive. *What if communication were something else?* Here, resistance, refusal, imagination, storytelling, and figurative language become potential alternatives to economized experience, as each may brush against the desire for efficiency. An apparatus prompts us to consider why and how. It joins the economical with the subjunctive by producing relations between them. An apparatus is not some underlying structure or ideal form. It's an agent for content and design, and it's often right in front us, like an interface&mdash;there, yet impossible to grasp. During seminar, I'll suggest that the key ingredients of an apparatus are *measurement, movement, sense, and making sense*, and we'll assess how apparatuses discipline and standardize experience while affording experimentation and speculation. We'll examine five apparatuses in particular (grids, editors, networks, stacks, and engines), though we'll need something to ground us and all our abstractions.  

What else but fiction to put us on the same page? We'll study media through discussions of radio dramas, fantasy, science fiction, comics, games, and experimental literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Call it escapism, if you wish; however, these fictions will be quite useful for understanding apparatuses and the economization of experience today. For one, they will nudge us to listen, watch, see, and play as well as read. They will also position audio, image, and text as *congealed labour*: processes and techniques rather than objects and instruments. From this position, we'll approach aesthetics as a question of embodied perception and sensation, and we'll talk about how some experiences of fiction are singular and others are shared. Fiction will also be a site for speculation and worldbuilding, and for stressing why both the content and design of the subjunctive matter. We'll ask what audio, image, and text mean and verify in fiction, but also what they do and, if you're so inclined, what they want. Perhaps most important, we'll consider aesthetics and politics together. How and under what assumptions are media and fiction categorized? How do media encourage and even rationalize particular ways of engaging fiction? How do we compose with, against, and even beyond the apparatuses that dominate cultural production? 

This is not a technical course. It's open to media practice (such as the composition of audio and video) without requiring it. The course does not involve any quantitative or computational methods, either. By "media," I mean "audio, image, and text," not "the media" or mass communications and their outlets. And by "media aesthetics," I mean the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced.

## Aims 

This seminar is an opportunity for us to attend to how: 

* Media are things and processes rather than "withdrawn" objects, resources on reserve, instruments of control, or purely subjective experiences. 
* Media are entwined with discipline and experimentation and thus prompt important questions about the possibility of not only critical distance but also romantic (or individualist) creativity.  
* Media and fiction are embodied social relations, not causes, effects, means, or autonomous works or structures. 
* Content and context have agency; fiction and history are not messages merely contained or transmitted by media.  
* Materials and experience have agency, too, hence the relevance of design to media and fiction.      
* Dichotomies such as analogue/digital, print/electronic, and static/interactive are often reductive, problematic categorizations of media and fiction. 
* Media and fiction morph together over time, with effects on how we define periods (modernism and postmodernism, for example). 
* We communicate and speculate both with and through media and fiction. 

The seminar contributes to your graduate education in English and/or Cultural, Social, and Political Thought by asking you to: 

* Watch, see, read, play, and listen to assigned materials. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice multimodal and comparative approaches to media and fiction. 
* Design a seminar project or essay with feedback from your peers and me. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice planning, drafting, and revising short- and long-form communications.  
* Compose a seminar project or essay, supported by an annotated bibliography and genealogy, on a topic relevant to media aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice making, supporting, expressing, and refining a long-form argument with a particular audience in mind.
* Present a seminar project or essay on a topic relevant to media aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice giving talks and participating in question-and-answer sessions. 
* Co-facilitate (with your peers and me) seminar discussions about assigned topics and materials. Here, my aim here is to create a space for you to practice sparking and sustaining conversations about media and fiction. 

I hope this approach to the seminar offers you room to experiment with your own take on media aesthetics. If you find that it does not, then please let me know, and I'll adjust my approach accordingly.  

## Background 

My name is Jentery Sayers. I’m an associate professor of English and  Cultural, Social, and Political Thought, and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I did my PhD at the University of Washington. Most of my work is in comparative media studies. I teach American fiction, cultural studies, media, materialism, and prototyping at UVic. 

I designed this course to correspond with similar research and teaching efforts in UVic's Department of English, including work in textual studies, book history, and film studies, where questions of mediation are central to scholarly analysis. This course is also an attempt to enact theory, such as posthumanist and (new) materialist theories, in studies of media and fiction. One result of this theoretical approach is less emphasis on distinct media and formats (such as books and film) and more attention to how media work across genres, experiments, and categories, hence the use of "media aesthetics" in the title instead of, say, "electronic literature," "interactive fiction," "audio fiction," "games," or "graphic novels." Finally, the course (like many of my previous seminars) is meant to serve a rather practical function by offering opportunities for you to approach material across modes (listening, seeing, playing, watching, and reading) and to define a project that aligns with your own interests in media aesthetics. This project may speak primarily to academic audiences, or it may have a non- or para-academic context in mind. 

Whatever your approach, the location of this seminar at UVic is key. The Department of English includes options for graduate students to complete MA essays *or* MA projects, and the university as a whole has a rich history of engaging media, broadly understood. From Special Collections to the Digital Scholarship Commons, you should have a chance to integrate your work with what's happening elsewhere on campus. This seminar and its background aim to prepare you for such integration by presenting you with *a framework for media praxis* as it pertains to fiction in particular and communication in general. Perhaps, for you, praxis leans toward theory, technique, narrative, history, poetics, or . . . I'm thus excited to see what you do with this framework and how you change and redirect it.

## Structure 

The first week is this seminar is intended mostly for introductions. We’ll meet each other, and I’ll review the syllabus and speak to the point of the seminar. Then we'll talk about media aesthetics and survey what we're studying this term. I'll conclude by sharing with you some relevant methods for approaching media and fiction. 

After Week 1, most weeks will include one or two modules organized around key issues in media aesthetics and communication. I’ll express those issues through questions or remarks that we might often hear or read. For example:

* Did You Get My Message? (a module on messengers, curation, and relating with others)
* Dear You: (a module on worldbuilding, oppression, and being addressed)
* Who's Calling? (a module on broadcasting, decoding, and colonial dissemination)
* Is Anyone Listening? (a module on acousmatic voices, gaslighting, and shouting into the abyss)
* You Already Said That. (a module on memory, playback, and emotional rapport with machines)
* Property of . . . (a module on graphic diaries and true stories that never happened)
* Click Here. (a module on links, forks, and portals)
* I’d Prefer Not To. (a module on resistance and refusal)

Each module corresponds with a particular work of fiction that will serve as a case study or "tutor text," if you will. 

The middle of the term (immediately after reading break) is dedicated to composing (or arguing) with and through media as a form of scholarship. I'll detail some approaches, and we'll look at some examples by scholars of media and fiction.

The end of the term is dedicated to your presentations (penultimate meeting) and workshopping your projects (last meeting). We'll also recap the seminar and our discussions of media aesthetics during the last meeting. Somewhere between the middle and the end, I'll ask you to meet with me to discuss your final project or essay.  

## Materials 

I'm asking you to access most materials online via their URLs or a passcode-protected reader I've compiled. (See me for the ID and passcode.) Links are provided in the [schedule](#schedule).  

Please purchase Alison Bechdel's [*Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/). It should be at the UVic Bookstore. I recommend purchasing the following: 

* Emil Ferris's [*My Favorite Thing Is Monsters*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters/) (also at the UVic Bookstore)   
* N.K. Jemisin's [*The Fifth Season*](https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/) 
* Toby Fox and Temmie Chang's [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/) 
* Fulbright's [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.game/) 

Of note, you can play *Gone Home* and *Undertale* with friends and watch gameplay videos of them online.  

Alongside these materials, I've dedicated a section of this syllabus to [notes](#notes). I'll populate that section as the term unfolds. I don't plan to use slides in this course; however, I will include in our seminar discussions various snippets of audio, image, and text from assigned fictions. As you study them, I recommend doing the same: consider screengrabs, sound clips, photographs, video, and whatnot for your own records and reference. If you'd like advice on annotating media, then let me know.  

You'll notice that most of the assigned materials are from the 21st century. I made these selections in part because I think (or hope) they will spark some engaging, if not pressing, seminar discussions about speculation and the apparatuses of media and fiction, but this decision to attend to the present does not mean we won't account for history in this course. During most modules, I'll provide overviews of where the assigned materials "fit," and how, in media, fiction, and theory since 1900. All that said, our aim will not be to defend a canon of material from the 20th and 21st centuries.
