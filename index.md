# Description 

Media are frequently treated as means in the business of making records. They help to verify communication occurred. *Did you get my message?* They also help to confirm meaning. *Do you understand it?* Such treatments tend to economize experience. Media should, for instance, facilitate the seizure and extraction of information. *Take a video. Capture some audio. Grab an image before it's gone.* They should function as proof. *I saw this. I heard that. I was there.* They should be efficient. *Give me the tl;dr.* They should secure consensus. *Don't you agree?* And they should accumulate and produce value. *Am I on brand?* 

This seminar accounts for the records business to move beyond it. That move is called "media aesthetics." Step one is speculation, and step two is attending to an apparatus&mdash;from economical communication to possible communications to how we even communicate. If economical communication verifies occurrence and confirms understanding, then speculation operates in the subjunctive. *What if communication were something else?* Here, resistance, refusal, storytelling, and figurative language become potential alternatives to economized experience, as each may brush against the desire for efficiency. An apparatus prompts us to consider why and how. It joins the economical with the subjunctive by producing relations between them. An apparatus is not some underlying structure or ideal form. It's an agent for content and design, and it's often right in front us, like an interface&mdash;there, yet impossible to grasp. During seminar, I'll suggest that the key ingredients of an apparatus are *measurement, movement, sense, and making sense*, and we'll assess how apparatuses discipline and standardize experience while affording experimentation and speculation. We'll examine five apparatuses in particular (grids, editors, networks, stacks, and engines), though we'll need something to ground us and all our abstractions.  

What else but fiction to put us on the same page? We'll study media through discussions of radio dramas, fantasy, science fiction, comics, games, and experimental literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Call it escapism, if you wish; however, these fictions will be quite useful for understanding apparatuses and the economization of experience today. For one, they will nudge us to listen, watch, see, and play as well as read. They will also position audio, image, and text as *congealed labour*: processes and techniques rather than objects and instruments. From this position, we'll approach aesthetics as a question of embodied perception and sensation, and we'll talk about how some experiences of fiction are singular and others are shared. Fiction will also be a site for speculation and worldbuilding, and for stressing why both the content and design of the subjunctive matter. We'll ask what audio, image, and text mean and verify in fiction, but also what they do and, if you're so inclined, what they want. Perhaps most important, we'll consider aesthetics and politics together. How and under what assumptions are media and fiction categorized? How do media encourage and even rationalize particular ways of engaging fiction? How do we compose with, against, and even beyond the apparatuses that dominate cultural production? 

This is not a technical course. The assignments are open to media practice (such as the composition of audio and video) without requiring it. The seminar does not involve any quantitative or computational methods, either. By "media," I mean "audio, image, and text," not "the media" or mass communications and their outlets. And by "media aesthetics," I mean the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced. In this case, we'll evaluate the design and content of fiction.  

# Aims 

This seminar is an opportunity for us to attend to how: 

* Media are things and processes rather than "withdrawn" objects, resources on reserve, instruments of control, or purely subjective experiences. 
* Media are entwined with discipline and experimentation and therefore prompt important questions about the viability of not only critical distance but also romantic (or individualist) creativity.  
* Media and fiction are embodied social relations, not causes, effects, means, or autonomous works or structures. 
* Content and context have agency; fiction and history are not messages merely contained or transmitted by media.  
* Materials and experience have agency, too, hence the relevance of design to media and fiction.      
* Dichotomies such as analogue/digital, print/electronic, and static/interactive tend to be problematic categorizations of media and fiction. 
* Media and fiction morph together over time, with effects on how we define periods (modernism and postmodernism, for example). 
* We communicate and speculate both with and through media and fiction. 

The seminar contributes to your graduate education in English and/or Cultural, Social, and Political Thought by asking you to: 

* Watch, see, read, play, and listen to assigned materials. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice multimodal and comparative approaches to media and fiction. 
* Design a seminar project or essay with feedback from your peers and me. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice planning, drafting, and revising short- and long-form communications.  
* Compose a seminar project or essay, supported by an annotated bibliography and genealogy, on a topic relevant to media aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice making, supporting, expressing, and refining a long-form argument with a particular audience in mind.
* Present a seminar project or essay on a topic relevant to media aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create a space for you to practice giving talks and participating in question-and-answer sessions. 
* Co-facilitate (with your peers and me) seminar discussions about assigned topics and materials. Here, my aim here is to create a space for you to practice sparking and sustaining conversations about media and fiction. 

I hope this approach to the seminar offers you room to experiment with your own take on media aesthetics. If you find that it does not, then please let me know, and I'll adjust my approach accordingly.  

# Background 

My name is Jentery Sayers. I’m an associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT), and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I did my PhD at the University of Washington. Most of my work is in comparative media studies. I teach American fiction, cultural studies, media, materialism, and prototyping at UVic. 

I designed this course to correspond with similar research and teaching efforts in UVic's Department of English, including work in literary studies, but also textual studies, book history, and film studies, where questions of mediation are central to scholarly analysis. As part of the CSPT concentration, this course is also an attempt to enact theory, such as posthumanist and (new) materialist theories, in studies of media and fiction. One result of this attempt is less emphasis on distinct media and formats (such as books and film) and more attention to how media work across genres, experiments, and categories, hence the use of "media aesthetics" in the title instead of, say, "electronic literature," "interactive fiction," "audio fiction," "games," or "graphic novels," each of which admittedly warrants a course unto itself. Finally, this seminar builds on previous "prototyping" seminars I've taught at UVic and is meant to serve a rather practical function by offering opportunities for you to approach material across modes (listening, seeing, playing, watching, and reading) and to iteratively develop a project or essay that aligns with your own interests in media aesthetics. This project or essay may speak primarily to academic audiences, or it may have a non- or para-academic context in mind. 

Whatever your ultimate approach, the location of this seminar at UVic is key. The Department of English includes options for graduate students to complete MA essays *or* MA projects, and the university as a whole has a rich history of engaging media, broadly understood. From Special Collections to the Digital Scholarship Commons, you should have a chance to integrate your work with what's happening elsewhere on campus. This seminar and its background aim to prepare you for such integration by presenting you with *a framework for media praxis* as it pertains to fiction in particular and communication in general. Perhaps, for you, praxis leans toward theory, technique, narrative, history, design, or . . . I'm thus excited to see what you do with the framework and how you change and redirect it.

# Structure 

The first week of this seminar is intended mostly for introductions. We'll meet each other, and I’ll review the syllabus and speak to the point of the course. Then we'll talk about media aesthetics and survey what we're studying this term. I'll conclude by sharing with you some relevant methods for approaching media and fiction. 

After Week 1, most weeks will include one or two modules organized around key issues in media aesthetics and communication. I’ll express those issues through questions or remarks that we might often hear or read. For example:

* "Did You Get My Message?" (a module on messengers, curation, and relating with others)
* "Who's Calling?" (a module on broadcasting, decoding, and colonial dissemination)
* "Is Anyone Listening?" (a module on acousmatic voices, gaslighting, and shouting into the abyss)
* "You Already Said That." (a module on memory, playback, and emotional rapport with machines)
* "Property of . . ." (a module on graphic diaries, cross-hatching, and true stories that never happened)
* "Click Here." (a module on links, forks, and portals)
* "I’d Prefer Not To." (a module on menus, refusal, and the design of encounters)

Each module corresponds with a particular work of fiction that will serve as a case study or "tutor text," if you will. 

The middle of the term (immediately after reading break) is dedicated to composing (or arguing) with and through media as a form of scholarship. I'll detail some approaches, and we'll look at some examples by scholars of media and fiction.

The end of the term is dedicated to your presentations (penultimate meeting) and workshopping your projects (last meeting). We'll also recap the seminar and our discussions of media aesthetics during the last meeting. Somewhere between the middle and the end, I'll ask you to meet with me to discuss your final project or essay. I'll give you two weeks after our last meeting to finalize and submit your project or essay.  

# Materials 

I'm asking you to access most materials online via their URLs or a passcode-protected reader I've compiled. (See me for the ID and passcode.) Links are provided in the [schedule](#schedule).

Please purchase Alison Bechdel's [*Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic*](http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/bechdel/). It should be at the UVic Bookstore. 

I recommend purchasing the following: 

* Emil Ferris's [*My Favorite Thing Is Monsters*](http://www.fantagraphics.com/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters/) (also at the UVic Bookstore)   
* N.K. Jemisin's [*The Fifth Season*](https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-fifth-season/) 
* Toby Fox and Temmie Chang's [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/) 
* Fullbright's [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.game/) 

Of note, you can play *Gone Home* and *Undertale* with friends and watch gameplay videos of them online.  

Alongside these materials, I've dedicated a section of this syllabus to [notes](#notes). I'll populate that section as the term unfolds. I don't plan to use slides during seminar; however, I will include in our discussions various snippets of audio, image, and text from assigned fictions. As you study them, I recommend doing the same: consider screengrabs, sound clips, photographs, video, and whatnot for your own records and reference. If you'd like advice on archiving and annotating media, then let me know.  

You'll notice that most of the assigned materials are from the 21st century. I made these selections in part because I think (or hope) they will spark some engaging, if not pressing, seminar discussions about speculation and the apparatuses of media and fiction; however, we'll still account for history in this course. For instance, during most modules I'll provide overviews of where the assigned materials "fit," and how, in media, fiction, and theory since 1900. I should also mention that my selections reflect an investment in narrative and storytelling. I did not include, for example, any artist's books or poetry, both of which are obviously relevant to studies of media and literature.  

# Schedule 

Here's the schedule for the term. I will notify you during seminar at least two weeks in advance of any changes. When materials are not open access or in the public domain, I abide by fair dealing guidelines. I also contributed to the artists' Patreon accounts, where applicable. 

To keep us on schedule, expect an email from me to everyone in the seminar once (and only once) per week. That weekly email should also encourage transparency and help us all plan ahead. I will often include lesson plans in my emails.

# Prompts 

I'm asking you to submit the following assignments this term: 

* Three co-facilitations of seminar discussion: each 5% of your final mark 
* An annotated bibliography of work related to a specific media and fiction technique: 15% of your final mark 
* A genealogy of that technique: 20% of your final mark 
* A presentation related to your final project or essay: 15% of your final mark 
* Final project or essay: 35% of your final mark 

I will provide in this section of the syllabus a prompt and rubric for each of these assignments. Please email me your bibliography, genealogy, and final project or essay in PDF, where possible. (I realize that most projects probably won't export well, if at all, to PDF.) If you have materials from your co-facilitations and/or presentation, then please email me those documents, too. 

**Co-Facilitations** 

I'm asking you to co-facilitate (with me and your peers) three seminar discussions this term. The aim of co-facilitation is to spark and sustain conversation about a work (on the schedule) you selected. I'll circulate sign-up sheets for co-facilitations, and we'll distribute the co-facilitations over the course of the term. You should plan to co-facilitate for 60 or so minutes of seminar. The rubric below should give you a sense of possible approaches. Please note that co-facilitations are not presentations. 

90-100 = A+: Co-facilitation in this range demonstrates an incredibly high level of engagement. You researched the work you selected, you sparked dialogue about it with your peers and me, you listened attentively to others in seminar (without dominating the conversation or even speaking that often), you took and shared notes when helpful, and you asked compelling questions that prompted an array of responses. You brought handouts, slides, or notes to guide conversation, and you kept us grounded in particular aspects of the work, without any tangents. During our discussion, we attended to matters of apprehension and comprehension as well as synthesis and evaluation of the work. You planned ahead and ran draft materials by other facilitators, including your peers and me. Where useful, you co-authored materials with other student co-facilitators. 

85-89 = A: Co-facilitation in this range demonstrates a high level of engagement. You researched the work you selected, you sparked dialogue about it with your peers and me, you listened attentively to others in seminar (without dominating the conversation or even speaking that often), you took and shared notes when helpful, and you asked compelling questions that prompted an array of responses. You kept us grounded in particular aspects of the work, without many tangents. During our discussion, we attended to matters of apprehension and comprehension as well as synthesis and evaluation of the work. You planned ahead and ran draft materials by other facilitators, including your peers and me. 

80-84 = A-: Co-facilitation in this range demonstrates a notable level of engagement. You researched the work you selected, you sparked dialogue about it with your peers and me, you listened to others in seminar (without dominating the conversation or even speaking that often), and you asked questions that prompted an array of responses. You kept us grounded in particular aspects of the work. During our discussion, we attended to matters of apprehension and/or comprehension as well as synthesis and/or evaluation of the work. You planned ahead and ran draft materials by other facilitators, including your peers and me.  

77-79 = B+: Co-facilitation in this range demonstrates a moderate level engagement. You sparked dialogue about your selected work with your peers and me, you listened to others in seminar, and you asked questions that prompted some responses. During our discussion, we attended to matters of apprehension and/or comprehension as well as synthesis and/or evaluation of the work. You planned ahead and ran draft materials by other facilitators, including your peers and me.  

73-76 = B: Co-facilitation in this range would benefit from more engagement. You sparked some dialogue about your selected work with your peers and me, and you asked questions that prompted some responses. During our discussion, we attended mostly to matters of apprehension and/or comprehension.

**Annotated Bibliography** 

Your annotated bibliography should help you to begin researching your final project or essay for this seminar. It should include at least ten sources, but no more than fifteen. Five (no more, no less) of the sources should be peer-reviewed journal articles. At least five other sources should be primary sources, such as works of fiction. Sources may be formatted according to MLA, APA, or Chicago. Each source should be accompanied by one or two descriptive sentences (what is it about? what's the argument or technique used?) as well as one or two evaluative sentences (why is it interesting? why might it be useful for your project or essay?). Note that the aim of your final project or essay is to engage media aesthetics via a particular technique that articulates or entwines media with fiction. So, not "maps and fantasy novels" or "audio and science fiction" but, for instance, worldbuilding or the use of second person in specific works of fantasy or science fiction. Please also note that I'm encouraging comparative, multi-author approaches to techniques at play in the 20th and 21st centuries. (The genealogy, due later in the term, should help with this element of the final project or essay.) At the top of the bib, please include no more than five sentences explaining the technique you're considering (you may certainly change your mind down the line) and why you think that technique may interest folks working in / around media aesthetics (what sort of questions or research does it spark?) At this point in the research, you can focus more on technique than authors or fictions. Before you select a technique, I recommend reviewing the 20 m's (see "Notes" below) as well as the schedule for the seminar through the end of March. Maybe there's something on the schedule that interests you, but we've not yet discussed it? You're of course welcome to run ideas by me. I'm around. Please email the bib to me by February 13th. PDF is preferred. DOCX and HTML are great, too.  

The components of the annotated bib, then: 

* Research on a project related to a technique at play in the 20th and 21st centuries that articulates or entwines media (audio, image, text) with fiction 
* At the top of the bib, no more than five sentences explaining the technique and why it's interesting 
* Between 10 and 15 sources in the bib 
* Five (no more, no less) sources should be peer-reviewed journal articles 
* At least five more sources should be primary sources, such as works of fiction 
* One or two descriptive sentences for each source (what is it about? what's the argument or technique?)
* One or two evaluative sentences for each source (why is it important? why might it be useful for your work?)
* Formatted in MLA, Chicago, or APA 
* Submitted to me by email by February 13th 
* PDF preferred; DOCX and HTML also work 

Here's the rubric: 

90-100 = A+: The annotated bibliography demonstrates research on a technique at play in the 20th and 21st centuries that articulates or entwines media with fiction. It explains the technique and why it may be interesting to people working in or around media aesthetics. It includes fifteen sources, five of which are peer-reviewed journal articles and at least five others that are primary sources. All sources are formatted according to MLA, Chicago, or APA. Each source is accompanied by descriptive and evaluative annotations that are clear, precise, and even insightful in their pithiness. The bibliography as a whole presents a compelling and potentially publishable seminar essay or project. Its engagement with media aesthetics and the selected technique is original yet supported by precedent in fiction, media, and/or literary and media studies.

It explains the technique and why it may be interesting to people working in or around media aesthetics. It includes at least ten sources, five of which are peer-reviewed journal articles and at least five others that are primary sources. All sources are formatted according to MLA, Chicago, or APA. Each source is accompanied by descriptive and evaluative annotations that are clear. The bibliography as a whole presents a promising seminar essay or project. Its engagement with media aesthetics and the selected technique is supported by precedent in fiction, media, and/or literary and media studies.

77-79 = B+: The annotated bibliography demonstrates research on a technique at play in the 20th and 21st centuries that articulates or entwines media with fiction. It explains the technique and why it may be interesting to people working in or around media aesthetics. It includes at least ten sources, five of which are peer-reviewed journal articles and at least five others that are primary sources. All sources are formatted according to MLA, Chicago, or APA. Each source is accompanied by descriptive and evaluative annotations that are clear. The bibliography as a whole presents a potential framework for a seminar essay or project. Its engagement with media aesthetics and the selected technique is supported by some precedent in fiction, media, and/or literary and media studies.
 
73-76 = B: The annotated bibliography demonstrates research on a technique at play in the 20th and 21st centuries that articulates or entwines media with fiction. It explains the technique and why it may be interesting to people working in or around media aesthetics. It includes at least ten sources, five of which are peer-reviewed journal articles and at least five others that are primary sources. All sources are formatted according to MLA, Chicago, or APA. Each source is accompanied by descriptive and evaluative annotations that are mostly clear. The bibliography as a whole presents an idea for a seminar essay or project. Its engagement with media aesthetics and the selected technique is supported by some precedent in fiction, media, and/or literary and media studies.

**Genealogy** 

Your genealogy should help you to articulate what's interesting about your selected technique and its uses in at least *three* works of fiction. (Where possible, select works by more than one artist or author. I recommend keeping the genealogy to no more than five works.) How and to what effects does the technique articulate media with fiction? What are the politics of this articulation? The aesthetics? What sort of apparatus is at play? What sort of speculations are made possible across media and fiction? Consider the genealogy to be a thorough description of "stress points" in your technique since 1900. You don't need to follow chronological order (as if the most recent use is the best use), you don't need many (if any) secondary sources to support your observations, and you don't even need to make an argument. Just thoroughly describe how the technique is used and what it's doing in at least three works of fiction; and as you do, tell your readers what's interesting (both politically and aesthetically) about these uses. Don't feel as if you need to present a tidy conclusion or a compelling introduction, either. Again, it's not an argument. You may even want to conclude the genealogy with some questions. It's not yet April, after all. 

The genealogy should be between 500 and 750 words, plus references, formatted in MLA, Chicago, or APA. Please email it to me in PDF or DOCX before seminar meets on Thursday, March 12th. Put your name on it. 

Here's the rubric (please read it when you have a sec): 

90-100 = A+: The genealogy articulates what's interesting about your selected technique and its uses in at least three works of fiction. It engages with nuance the politics and aesthetics of the technique, an apparatus at play, and the speculations made possible. Its observations are both compelling and original. It exhibits the beginnings of publishable research in or around the field of media aesthetics. 

85-89 = A: The genealogy articulates what's interesting about your selected technique and its uses in at least three works of fiction. It engages with nuance the politics and aesthetics of the technique, an apparatus at play, and the speculations made possible. Its observations are compelling and occasionally original. 

80-84 = A-: The genealogy articulates what's interesting about your selected technique and its uses in at least three works of fiction. It engages with nuance the politics and aesthetics of the technique, an apparatus at play, and the speculations made possible. Its observations are compelling. 

77-79 = B+: The genealogy articulates what's interesting about your selected technique and its uses in at least three works of fiction. It engages the politics and aesthetics of the technique. Its observations are occasionally compelling. 
 
73-76 = B: The genealogy articulates what's interesting about your selected technique and its uses in at least three works of fiction. 

**Presentation** 

Prompt and rubric coming soon. 

**Final Project or Essay** 

Your final essay or project for "Media Aesthetics" should engage a particular technique at play in the 20th and 21st centuries that articulates or entwines media with fiction. It should be grounded in material from works of fiction. Your argument should be presented in 2500-4000 words (plus notes and references) or the equivalent across media (audio, image, text). It should be accompanied by a 250-word abstract or project description, and you should identify a particular venue (such as a journal, program, or initiative) for it. You should meet with me by March 19th to discuss your plans for the essay or project. At least two days prior to that meeting, you should email me a draft proposal (250 words), and during that meeting we'll discuss potential revisions to the topic, scope, shape, and content of your proposal. I will also compose with you five outcomes for your essay or project. Three of those outcomes will be drafted by you, the other two by me. I'll then revise them all for consistency and clarity. At the term's end, I'll use those five outcomes to assess your essay or project (where an A+ will imply a publishable project or essay, an A will imply the work exceeds the outcomes, an A- will imply the work exceeds some of the outcomes, a B+ will imply the work meets the outcomes, and a B will imply the work did not meet some or all of the outcomes). You will present aspects of your essay or project during seminar on March 26th and workshop it on April 2nd. It's due by Thursday, April 16th. (Extensions may be granted if you contact me in advance.) You can submit your final essay or project by email, in person, or via my department box. Make sure you note the intended venue when you submit it. 

# Notes 

As the term unfolds, I will share in this section my notes and reflections. Expect new content here almost every week of seminar.  

### Definitions

From our first meeting (January 9th), here are some definitions of key terms I'm using to engage media and fiction. After "media" and "fiction," they are alphabetized.   
 
* **Fiction**: a work of audio, image, and/or text that imagines, if only in part, its character(s), world(s), and/or events(s); has a story that's arranged with narrative; may be read, watched, played, seen, and/or heard
* **Media**: congealed labour or techniques made durable; not "the media" (singular) or "mass media" of the communications industry; three primary examples in this course are audio, image, and text 
* **Apparatus**: a mechanism used to measure media and fiction and also economize people's experiences; examples in this course include editors, grids, engines, stacks, and networks 
* **Audio**: a congealed way of hearing and composing; at once process and thing                          
* **Format**: a way to nest, circulate, or store media; examples include novels, comics, games, and radio            
* **Genre**: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of engaging fiction; classic examples are tragedy or comedy, but other examples include fantasy, science fiction, detective, slapstick, romance, action, adventure, horror, mystery, simulation, role-playing, and suspense     
* **Image**: a congealed way of seeing and composing; at once process and thing
* **Labour**: what congeals in media but cannot be recorded completely by it; the activities people individually and collectively perform to produce work; examples include emotional, mental, physical, sensual, manual, and machine labour  
* **Narrative**: how the story in a work of fiction is structured and arranged; components include setup, focalization, character development, and the uses of narrators, flashbacks, and sequencing 
* **Norms**: worldviews that fiction and media both reproduce and resist; ideologies that discipline perception, the production of knowledge, and social and cultural practice; necessarily exclude some ways of hearing, seeing, reading, and composing in favour of other ways   
* **Play**: a negotiation or experiment with the meanings, materials, and modes of media and fiction; need not involve explicit rules; also the primary way of engaging games
* **Prototype**: a possibility presented through media and fiction; associated terms include sketch, scenario, wireframe, experiment, and draft; not a real or finished product with a brand; usually doesn't involve post-production   
* **Story**: the setting(s), plot, character(s), conflict(s), and point(s) of view in a work of fiction
* **Style**: what people say is unique about how a given person or group composes with audio, images, and/or text; an artist's or author's "signature"   
* **Technology**: a system, such as phonography, photography, print, and computing, that reproduces media; usually involves automation  
* **Text**: a congealed way of reading and composing; at once process and thing   
* **Work**: an output or result of labour, such as a work of fiction; not just an object or thing, but its content, apparatus, and the processes that went into making and circulating it 

Again, these definitions are not exhaustive. I'm providing them to render transparent my own assumptions and approaches. Equally important, definitions are often quite fuzzy or contingent with history and culture. They are more like guides for situations than answers to important questions, and they should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. What's missing from them? What do people want from them? What makes them work? I thus hope you'll question and revise these definitions rather than adopting them wholesale for deployment in this seminar or elsewhere.

### Why Media?

What is the point of studying media and fiction together in the 2020s? Consider the following list, introduced during our first meeting (January 9th). It translates how this seminar applies generally to the practice of communication and specifically to its analytical, structural, social, cultural, and practical dimensions. None of these applications is restricted to the academy. 

Approaching media and fiction together attends to matters of: 

* **Situation**, or the *context of communication*, including how, when, and where people relate and collaborate through particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Composition**, or the *content of communication*, including what people read, see, hear, watch, and play in particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Audience**, or the *purpose of communication*, including what people need, want, and/or expect from particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Norms**, or the *values of communication*, including what people deem to be credible, compelling, biased, predictable, or problematic about particular media and/or fictions. 
* **Novelty**, or the *uniqueness of communication*, including how and why particular media and/or fiction are considered to be innovative, disruptive, experimental, or generic. 
* **Engagement**, or the *experience of communication*, including what people feel and remember about particular media and/or fiction. 
* **Design**, or the *interface of communication*, including what people notice and ignore and how they navigate content and context. 

I use the acronym **SCANNED** (I know, I know . . .) to remember this list and to state succinctly why people might approach media and fiction together.

### The 20 M's

"Media aesthetics" is the framework we'll use to approach media and fiction in this course. I define it as *the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced*. These terms are defined below. 

We'll use 20 words starting with the letter "m" to facilitate our study of media and fiction through media aesthetics. The list is a guide, not a set of instructions, and will inevitably fall apart with some practice and pressure. In the list I avoid common dichotomies between mind and body, logic and feeling, and analysis and experience, mostly because such dichotomies are driven by norms or ideals frequently critiqued within media and literary studies. Although there's an order to the outline, with "Apprehension" appearing first, it's not a hierarchy or series of steps. The "Evaluation" section may prompt revisions to "Synthesis," for example, or some people may wish to start with "Comprehension." I use "work" throughout the guide to refer to a work of fiction and its media (audio, image, and text), and I encourage repeated description to render the process as approachable as possible. Suggestions welcome.  

**Apprehension** 

"What's happening here?" Apprehension is about impressions, sensations, and evocations. It's about the moment, which may be familiar. "I've felt this before." While experience may feel personal, it's social, too. It's structured by media and fiction, and it's shaped by design.   

* Describe the [*materials*](#material) used. 
* Describe the [*modes*](#modes) or senses engaged. 
* Describe the [*mood*](#mood) inhabited or experienced. 

Consider recording or annotating your (initial) engagement in real time (like an unboxing video or Let's Play), if only for your own records. With express consent, you might do the same for someone else and then compare your results. Account for eye rolls and anxious feelings as well: what's off-putting, predictable, unclear, discomfiting, frustrating . . . Apprehension isn't necessarily appreciation.   

**Comprehension** 

"What's this about?" Comprehension is about expressions, understanding, and situating things. It's about making sense after the fact&mdash;identifying and arranging the parts. While it may feel impersonal, it's nevertheless motivated. People usually want meaning and even purpose from media and fiction. 

* Describe the [*modules*](#modules) or parts of the work. 
* Describe the units used to [*measure*](#measure) the work and its parts.  
* Describe the [*main content*](#main-content) of the story (who, what, when, and where).
* Describe the work's history, its network, and its [*moment*](#moment) of composition (who, what, when, and where). 

Consider distilling the work, reflecting on it, and even graphing its parts, story, and/or relation to other works in its network. Note how and when these practices are about control, or the pleasure of making sense of things. When is control problematic? What do graphs or classifications get wrong? 

**Synthesis** 

"How does it all come together?" Synthesis is about boundaries and relations. It entwines apprehension with comprehension. It connects materials with abstractions and personal experiences with structures and designs. It's never total or complete; it can't and shouldn't account for all the things.  

* Describe how (you assume) the work was [*made*](#made). 
* Get [*meta*](#meta). Describe how the story is told.
* Describe what the work [*means*](#means) (or its multiple, incongruous *meanings*). 
* Describe how it [*massages*](#massage) or [*manipulates*](#massage) people's senses.
* Describe how people [*move*](#move) with, within, across, and beyond it. 
* Describe what [*motivates*](#motivates) people to return to and/or identify with it. 
* Describe how it and responses to it have [*morphed*](#morphed) over time. 
* Describe how it is or would be collected and [*maintained*](#maintained) over time. 

Consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. Otherwise, the process may be overwhelming. 

**Evaluation** 

"So what?" Evaluation is about assessment, or why people should care about the work and engagements with it. Evaluations have intended audiences; knowing that audience and their expectations focuses the inquiry. 

* Describe how the work [*mediates*](#mediates) its relation to power and "common sense" (norms, assumed knowledge, and congealed ways of perceiving). 
* Describe who and what it [*misses*](#misses), ignores, or essentializes.  
* Describe the [*memories*](#memories) it elicits and how it elicits them. 
* Describe how it functions as [*mimesis*](#mimesis) (show, drama) and diegesis (tell, narrative) within and against its network.  

Again, consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. A response may not be an essay or series of paragraphs. Compose with audio, image, and/or text to determine what sticks with you and/or what others deem to be most compelling.  

**Action** 

"What to do about it all?" Action is about learning and intervention: what people do with a work of media and fiction they encounter and study. Perhaps they do nothing with it. Preferring not to is indeed a sort of action. But so are improving the work, responding to it, integrating it into a project, discussing it with others, and drawing motivation from it. "Active learning" assumes many forms.  

* *Mobilize* the work: change it, prototype with it, teach it, critique it, exhibit it, write about it. 

Consider how a given work of media and fiction intersects with your own interests and trajectories and then determine how to communicate these intersections to (or with) other people.

### Apparatuses

Approaches to media in fiction rely heavily on how media are measured: how they are divided into components and then isolated, traversed, compared, contrasted, and the like. These components are not the inevitable output of technologies. They are decisions with histories, norms, and expectations. That is, they are made and used often, they have conventions, and people want or assume particular experiences from them. They are also entwined with disciplines and discourses, such as how people talk about games, comics, radio, and books. A mechanism for the production of these components may be called an "apparatus."

An apparatus is not exactly a form or template. It's a relation machine. It helps people to sense and make sense of media in fiction&mdash;to measure media, build vocabularies for media, and move between, within, across, beyond, and to media.

Here's a list of five apparatuses at play in this seminar. I shared it during our first meeting (January 9th). After each apparatus, I mention some components they produce and some relations they enable. I imagine a few of the terms may be unfamiliar, so we'll discuss them during the term. 

* **The Grid**: produces panels and gutters in comics; columns, margins, headers, and lexia on pages; and snap guides in design software; relations premised on flatness, surface, sequence, syntax, scanning, and juxtaposition
* **The Stack**: produces a front end and back end as well as presentation, logic, and database layers; relations premised on depth, dependencies, access, and visibility 
* **The Network**: produces paths, maps, branches, and nodes; relations premised on links, forks, paradigms, and wandering 
* **The Editor**: produces tracks, segments, fades, cuts, splices, wipes, and effects; relations premised on ellipsis, sequence, condensing, synchronization, and simultaneity 
* **The Engine**: produces worlds, theatres, and models; relations premised on programming, simulation, immersion, and immediacy  

These apparatuses of course intersect. Any given web project, for instance, may involve all of them. Equally interesting, an apparatus may not be explicit in people's engagements with media. The lines of a grid or the graphs for a network rarely appear on page or screen, and an engine usually wants people to forget they're inside a program or world. An apparatus is thus more like an interface. It's there, with palpable consequences; it's just not tangible or tactile.   

An apparatus has clear implications for design, yet it's relevant to studies of fiction, too. If an apparatus is a relation machine, then those relations likely congeal with repeated and collocated use, understood in fiction as genre. Here's another list, then. It uses prepositions to mark relations enabled by apparatuses and then experiments with those prepositions to describe components and experiences common in particular genres, which I italicize. 

* **At (spectacle)**: privileges the coherence of audio, image, and/or text into a single presentation; the story matters less than the experience; spectacles are common in *action and adventure*   
* **Within (worldbuilding)**: privileges the configuration of audio, image, and/or text as components in a system with rules or conventions; a story is played or inhabited; worldbuilding is common in *fantasy, science fiction, and roleplaying*        
* **Between (texture)**: privileges friction or tension between components of audio, image, and/or text; a story emerges from play or ambiguity and may promise resolution; texture is common in *strategy, comedy, and detective fiction*   
* **Across (deferral)**: privileges the use of audio, image, and/or text to make promises and then postpone delivery; the story thrives on what is or could be next; deferral is common in *mystery, horror, thrillers, and suspense*   
* **Beyond (epic)**: privileges pointing to audio, image, and/or text found elsewhere; the story is part of and refers to something larger; epic is common in *sagas, encyclopedic fiction, and historical fiction* 
* **To (address)**: privileges interpellation (hey you!) or identification (it me!) via components of audio, image, and/or text; address is common in *simulation and coming-of-age fiction*    

These aren't recipes for genres, and this isn't an exercise in totalization (as if one list could capture everything about genre). It's simply a starting point for approaching media in fiction through an apparatus. I return to the notion of genre later in this course. For now, I'll repeat here my definition of it: "genre: when fiction congeals into recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations; may become someone's preferred way of engaging fiction." The apparatus of media, or how they're measured, shapes these conventions and expectations.

### Material

As part of "apprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider the materials used in the work of fiction. Materials are about the work as matter and physical substance. Here are some ways to think about materials:  

* Presence: Can you touch or handle it? 
* Texture: Is it smooth or rough? 
* Ephemera: What about it disappears, or what's ghostly or mutable about it? 
* Visibility: What materials can you see? Not see?  
* Audibility: Does it make a sound? what materials can you hear?
* Packaging: Is it packaged? If so, describe the packaging. 
* Recording: How is it recorded? Can you handle or see the record? 

"Material" prompts considerations of the work as *stuff*. 

---

### Modes

As part of "apprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider the modes or senses engaged. Modes and senses are about how people's bodies are engaged or addressed by fiction. Here are some ways to think about modes and senses:  

* Through the five senses (hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and touching), including which are engaged more than others by the work(s) of fiction at hand.  
* WOVEN: writing (including reading), oral (what's said and heard), visual (colour, layout, and images, for instance), electronic (how the work transmits media, and whether it's electronic), and nonverbal (gesture, audio, and movement, for instance). Thanks to [Georgia Tech's Writing and Communication Program](https://wcprogram.lmc.gatech.edu/posters/woven) for this approach and the acronym, WOVEN. 
* Agency: are you moving / engaging with or against the work? Maybe somewhere in between? What's the flow? Are you in control? Do you want to be?  

"Modes" and senses prompt considerations of *attention and how we attend*.  

---

### Mood

As part of "apprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider the mood. The mood is about being in the world and engaging fiction. What's the work's vibe or feel? Here are some ways to think about mood: 

* Describe the work as an encounter. What or whom are you encountering? Does it feel close or distant? 
* Describe the work as an atmosphere. What's the "weather" of the work? 
* Describe the work's tone. Is it serious? Playful? Vague? Direct? 
* Describe the work as a feeling. Any goosebumps? What emotions or experiences do you associate with it? 

"Mood" prompts considerations of *distance, immediacy, and familiarity.* 

---

### Modules

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider modules, which draw attention the work's composition and arrangement. Here are some ways to think about modules: 

* Is the work available as a collection of component parts or files? If so, describe them. (Consider a website, for instance. It may have HTML, CSS, and media files.)
* Describe the components or elements of the work's composition, even if they are not available as a collection of parts or files. (Consider radio drama or podcasts, for instance. Their components may include dialogue (DX), sound effects (SFX), background sound (BG), and music (MX). Or, consider comics. Their components may include panels, gutters, tiers, and speech bubbles.) 

"Modules" prompt considerations of the *relationships between parts and whole*. 

---

### Measure 

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider measurements. To measure is to assess and/or quantify media, fiction, and engagements with them. Here are some ways to think about measurements:  

* Length: the work as pages, words, or minutes, for example.  
* Progress: the work as levels or the distance to the end, for example. 
* Success: the work as points or a collection, for example. 
* Body/Content: the work as chapters, worlds, scenarios, or episodes, for example. 
* Presentation: the work as its screen (size), resolution, compression, or fidelity, for example.  
* Attention: the work as clicks, views, sales, or ratings, for example.  

"Measurements" prompt considerations of *value*. 

---

### Main Content 

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider the main content or story. Here are some ways to think about content: 

* Characters: humans, robots, nonhuman animals, mythological creatures, and even environments or parts of the environment  
* Setting: time, place, and location of the story 
* Plot: major events and what happens, typically understood through exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement / resolution   
* Theme: core ideas, threads, and even morals / lessons
* Conflict: between characters, events, groups, and/or environments (the tension upon which the story relies) 
* Point of view: first, second, or third-person (omniscient or limited)

"Main content" prompts considerations of *shared interpretation*, or what puts people on the same page.  

---

### Moment

As part of "comprehension" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider the moment(s) of the work's composition, circulation, and reception. The moment is about context. Here are some ways to think about a moment: 

* Identify who was (or is) involved in the work. Consider who got credit and for what. 
* Identify when it was made and circulated. Consider what other kinds of work were popular at that time. 
* Describe what was happening when it was made and circulated. Consider important historical, cultural, and artistic events as well as what the authors / artists were doing at (or around) the time. 
* Describe where the work was made and circulated. Consider its network, geographic location, and "scene." In some cases, the network may be quite literal: a radio or tv network, for instance. 
* Describe its reception over time. Compare its reception now with its reception then. Also consider reception across different venues or groups of people. 

"Moment" prompts considerations of *shared situations*, or what about a work puts people in the same space and/or time. 

---

### Made

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider how the work was made. How did it come together? How did this become that? Of note, it's pretty much impossible to fully capture and describe this process, even if you can access, say, notes, documentation, or designer diaries. But here are some ways to determine or conjecture how a work was made: 

* Visit a collection in person or online. Libraries, archives, and museums often have materials describing and/or documenting how works were made. 
* Use the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) or a similar service to compare versions of a work over time. (See "Morphed" below, too.) 
* Read blogs and the like. Maybe those involved in the work shared their process in writing, through video, etc. 
* Imitate the work. Make your own personal copy of it and document the process along the way. 
* Deconstruct the work. If possible, take it apart, put it back together, and document the process along the way.  
* Go backwards. Start at the end, work your way to the beginning, and document the process (or experience) along the way. 
* Check the source code, if available and applicable. You might find some insightful comments there. 

"Made" prompts considerations of *process* over product.  

---

### Meta

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may get meta about how the story is told. Here are some ways to get meta. Consider the:  

* Situation: What's known or taken for granted in the work? How do characters understand each other (or so we assume)?
* World: What's the scope and scale of the setting and its systems, history, mythologies, and/or landscape? How is the world of the work bigger or more expansive than the story itself? 
* Duration: How long does the story take to communicate certain things? How does it use abbreviation, summary, stretched time, or warped time? What moves quickly? What doesn't? 
* Frequency: What's repeated? What are the patterns or textures of the work? 
* Sequencing: How is the work arranged chronologically (analepsis, prolepsis) and non-chronologically? How does it use leveling (via goals and progressive disclosure)? Or branching (via a map or tree)?  
* Evocation: How does the work draw on memories and resemblances?
* Focalization: How do we get our knowledge from characters and/or narrators (zero = omniscient narrator who knows more than characters, internal = narrator is a character and thus knows what the character knows, and external focalization = narrator or camera eye telling less than what characters know)?
* Narration (compare with plot above): How is the story told? Often involves abstract (summary), orientation (time and place), complicating action, resolution (climax), evaluation (commentary or elucidation), and coda (time of story meets time of narrative).

"Meta" prompts considerations of *design and structure*. 

---

### Means

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider what the work means to you and others. Meaning is produced in all sorts of ways. Here are some ways to think about it:   

* Describe why the work is, or was, considered to be important in a given moment, or why people say it matters.  
* Describe how the work produces multiple, even incongruous interpretations. Or, describe why people interpret it in multiple, even incongruous ways. 
* Describe the effect of one of the work's devices or techniques, such as irony, allegory, metafiction, worldbuilding, collage, montage, voiceover, chance, accumulation, role-play, point of view, or allusion. 
* Identify what you consider to be the most important meaning of the work and explain whether that meaning is referential (points to something in or beyond the work), explicit (what it says directly), implicit (symbols or codes), or symptomatic (unstated beliefs, assumptions, or ideologies). (I'm borrowing these terms from David Bordwell.) 
* Identify aspects of, or moments in, the work that resist meaning or are indifferent to it. 

"Meaning" prompts considerations of *significance*. 

---

### Massage

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider how the work massages or manipulates people's senses. Here are some ways to think about massage and manipulation:  

* Is the work securing consensus? If so, then how? And what sort of consensus? 
* Is the work a distraction? If so, then how? And from what? 
* Is the work immersive? If so, then how? And in what does it immerse people?   
* Does the work involve interaction? Is it responsive? Does it invite input? Or maybe dialogue? If so, then how does it change, if at all, with each interaction? 
* Does the work have a rhythm? If so, then what is it? And how does it affect flow?  
* Does the work involve simultaneity? Does it ask you to balance things or to multitask? If so, then to what effects? 
* Does the work address you (hey you! hi there)? If so, then how? Directly or indirectly? Under what assumptions?       

Massaging and manipulation prompt considerations of *discipline, ideology, and pleasure.*

### Move 

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider how people move with the work. Here are some ways to think about movement:   

* Arrangement and layout: How does the work guide interpretation and experience? How does it structure play and perception? 
* Mechanics and actions: How does the work prompt input? What are the mechanics? The horizons of action? How do people act? How does the work act? 
* Expected and unexpected: How does the work play with expectations? What moves are surprising? Predictable? 
* Repetition and amplitude: What moves does the work ask people to rehearse? What's intense or loud about its movement? What's subtle or implied?
* Idleness and inaction: How does the work invite or afford idleness or inaction? What happens when people don't engage or participate? 
* Rules and boundaries: How and where does the work draw boundaries? Where can't people go in the work, or what can't they do? 
* Embodiment: How and when does the work draw attention to people's unique, embodied experiences? How and when does it ignore or standardize those experiences? 

"Move" prompts considerations of *activity and anticipation*.

### Motivates

As part of "synthesis" in [the 20 m's](#the-20-ms), you may want to consider what motivates people to attend and return to a work. Here are some ways to approach such motivation:  

* Describe the work as a community, network, or social experience. What brought or brings people to it? 
* Describe the work as an embodied experience. What's pleasurable (or not) about it?  
* Describe why people might want to research the work. What about it rewards study? 

Motivation prompts considerations of *traction*.

### Audio and Fiction 

If you're working on the use of audio in fiction, then these terms may be helpful. 

**Acousmatic sound** 

May be defined as: 

1. The practice of listening to sound without attention to its source (acousmatic listening)
2. A sound separated from its source (not what is seen but what is heard)
3. A sound effect 
4. A sound object or sample ("canned" sound) 

**Soundscape**

May be defined as: 

1. A collection of sounds 
2. Sounds of the everyday evironment and atmosphere (not "composed" but a product of routine activities)
3. A component of ambient music or ambient sound
4. Sounds associated with a place or situation 
5. The background sound or music of a work of fiction 

**Sound design**

Often includes components such as: 

* DX: dialogue (between characters) 
* MX: music 
* SFX: sound effect (part of the soundscape) 
* BG: background, ambient sound (may be composed or recorded) 
* FOL: foley (triggered by player action in games or made post-production by foley artists) 

**Voice-over** 

May be defined as what's said by a speaker who is either not seen or is communicating from a moment before or after what's being seen. While many definitions of voice-over are preoccupied with the "location" of the narrator (e.g., "non-diegetic" sounds or narration, which do not occur within the "world" of the story), it's perhaps more productive to treat voice-over as yet another audio element of a work. Voice-over links voice with other sounds as well as with text and images. The speaker often recounts events happening on screen (or within a frame) and/or provides perspective or understanding for those events. Voice-over is common in the use of flashbacks and dream sequences, for instance. 

Here are some ways to approach what voice-over is doing in a given work: 

* Exposition, where the narrator describes what's seen or happening, often by providing background or contextual information (e.g., [*Barry Lyndon*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=54) and [*Amelie*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=62)) 
* Recollection, where the narrator recalls and perhaps reflects on events in which they participated (e.g., [*Kind Hearts and Coronets*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=34))
* Privileged access, where the narrator tells the audience something they either may not or do not say to other characters; or, the narrator conveys something either audiences are not seeing or characters do not know or perceive (e.g., [*Trainspotting*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=25) and [*Y Tu Mamá También*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=57))
* Meta, where the narrator comments on the narration or the act of narration; sometimes the characters talk back to the narrator (e.g., [*The Opposite of Sex*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk), [*George of the Jungle*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=92), and [*Hot Shots! Part Deux*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=110)) 
* Testimony, where the narrator serves as a witness to events and may even represent them by speaking on their behalf (e.g., [*Blade Runner*](https://youtu.be/3_qW-xPanqU?t=152))
* Direct address, where the narrator speaks directly to the audience, often as a character, breaking the "fourth wall" (e.g., [*Ferris Bueller's Day Off*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=163), [*Fight Club*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=163), and [*Deadpool*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=163))
* Disruption, where the narrator intervenes actively in the composition or story, usually with a notable effect on flow or rhythm (e.g., [*Bande à part*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=42))
* Command or direction, where the narrator makes something appear or occur on screen (e.g., [*The Wolf of Wall Street*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=83) and [*George of the Jungle*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=92))
* Commentary, where the narrator remarks on what's seen or happening, often for comedic or manipulative purposes (e.g., [*The Big Lebowski*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=142) and [*Sunset Blvd.*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=29))
* Knowledge gap, where the narrator's descriptions suggest they may not follow or fully grasp what's seen or happening (e.g., [*Badlands*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=200))
* Autonomy, where voice-over and image run in parallel, without the need for synchronization or cohesion (e.g., [*The Thin Red Line*](https://youtu.be/I7wPUNTBkVk?t=224))

The voice-over may be recognized for the "grain" of its voice (its signature) or the "voice" of the grain (the signature or trace of a sound recording on wax, vinyl, tape, etc.). Finally, people often want to hear themselves in voices (see the story of Echo and Narcissus). What assumptions are at play in such desires? 

I'm borrowing some of this language from Sarah Kozloff, Linda Martín Alcoff, Michel Chion, and Roland Barthes.

### Images and Fiction

If you're working on images in fiction, then the following terms and notes may be helpful. 

Images may be interpreted as: 

* **Traces** with material links to space and time. They evoke [memories](#memories) and often point to [moments](#moment) from the past. This act of pointing is called an *index*. 
* **Perspectives** that [measure](#measure) and shape how we see the world. These perspectives are shaped by the technologies we use (e.g., cameras) but also by culture and norms (e.g., the "gaze," or the act of looking at and even objectifying people). Cindy Sherman's ["Untitled Film Stills"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik6hva9qsKg&feature=emb_title) (1977-80)  experiments with these norms. Perspective is often associated with *framing*. Frames both include and exclude the material of images, prompting us to ask what's not seen and who is assumed to be the viewer or audience. Norman Rockwell has some fun with framing (including frames within frames) in his ["Triple Self-Portrait."](https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/11/rockwell-finally-appears/)
* **Experiences** that engage, [manipulate](#massage), and [massage](#massage) our [modes](#modes) of perception. They address us. They look back (e.g., a subject who makes eye contact with the audience) but also function as sensory input. *Optical* images are screens, projectors, or mirror reflections that address us. *Perceptual* images are images impressed on us after seeing, watching, or playing something; they are the images we remember or recall after the experience. 
* **Representations** that resemble people, places, and things in the world. They imitate life; this imitation is called "mimesis" (showing rather than telling). Such a resemblance is called an *icon*, like characters in a comic or the button for an app. 
* **Composed** or [made](#made). They have centres and edges. They use colour. They have elements conventions. They show and tell. They are not "captured" or "taken," even when they are photographs. The fact that images are made prompts attention to their *format* (from drawings to paintings to photographs to animation to sprites to video). 
* **Language** that have or produce [meaning](#means). They concentrate or focus meaning while also excluding or resisting it. They are both *symbols* and *signs*. Importantly, symbols are arbitrary and abstract; they work independently of context. Signs, which are also symbols, are comprised of signifiers (the word "cat") and signifieds (an image of cat in your mind). When we ask what an image means, we're treating it as language (as a symbol or sign). We may also want it to mean something deeper than what appears on the surface. 
* **Imagined** or mental images, such as dreams, ideas, and even [memories](#memories). We may have mental images of things that don't exist or happened so long ago we can't recall the particulars. We may imagine an image before we draw, write, design, or the like. 
* **Stories** we assemble and interpet, often in the moment. Images often prompt us to complete a sequence, even when there's no sequence to complete. They play on what comes before and after, on our anticipation and expectations. We [move](#move) with them. 

Today, the word image often refers to *graphic* images: maps, graphs, photographs, drawings, and the like. Graphic images rely on marks, and they can be circulated as *pictures*. But images may also imply *likeness*: not the picture in hand or on screen but what the image resembles or reveals. Cartoons, for instance, don't look exactly like who or what they represent; however, they do express likeness (the essence, spirit, style, aura, or *image* of who or what's represented). 

**Comics** 

When we consider how images are made in comics, the following terms are often used: 

* **Panel**: an image on a page; often has a border; many panels may appear on one page; the number and their relation speaks to a comic's "panel density"   
* **Tier**: a row of panels 
* **Gutter**: the space between panels 
* **Splash**: the drawing (usually large) that opens a story; may serve the purpose of exposition 
* **Spread**: an image spanning more than one page 
* **Speech Bubble**: a bubble in and even beyond a panel containing text for monologue and dialogue
* **Caption**: text of narration and commentary in the gutter 

These notes draw from work by Lisa Cartwright, Hillary Chute, Gilles Deleuze, Mary Ann Doane, Scott McCloud, W.J.T. Mitchell, Charles Sanders Peirce, Susan Sontag, and Marita Sturken.

### Games and Fiction

If you're working on games and fiction, then following may be useful. 

Components of a game (drawn from the work of Walker White): 
* Engine (for physics, graphics, sound, and game dynamics) 
* Rules (framework or guidelines for action) and mechanics (the actions afforded) 
* Interface (for options, navigation, and menus) 
* Content (such as the story, characters, conditions, levels, and audio, image, and text) 
* Play (uncompelled or uncoerced negotiation with the components above; a relation between game and player) 

Some key terms for games (drawn from the work of Anna Anthropy, Naomi Clark, Alexander Galloway, Brenda Romero, and Brian Upton): 
* Game state: all variables at play in a given scenario; may include everything from number of players and components to possible actions and conflicts to goals and win conditions; essentially the game’s "metagame"
* Phase space: the conceptual space representing possible game states; helps to account for movement from one location to the next; has direction and goals built into it (such as unlocking, levels, and disclosure) 
* Playspace or actionable space: the actual, playable gameworld, where players negotiate with game states and phase space 
* Horizon of action: the synthesis of states attainable (according to the game) and states desired (by a player) 
* Goals: desired game states, or games states with a special status 
* Trajectory: path through phase and play space toward horizon of action 
* Types of action (care of Alexander Galloway): diegetic machine act (the game proceeds without the player), diegetic player act (such as player character movement, expression, and dialogue), non-diegetic machine act (such game goals, points, stats, bugs, and crashes), and non-diegetic player action (such as pressing pause or selecting options)

Evaluation of games (drawn from the work of Anna Anthropy, Naomi Clark, Brenda Romero, and Brian Upton): 
* Choice: What possible actions, or "verbs," are afforded by horizons of action?  
* Variety: How much repetition occurs in the horizon of action?  
* Consequence: To what degree do actions have palpable/clear outcomes? 
* Predictability: To what degree can actions, or "verbs," be anticipated?  
* Uncertainty: To what degree are the outcomes predetermined? 
* Satisfaction: To what degree are desirable outcomes attainable?  
* Values: How do the actions and horizons of action correspond with particular worldviews? What do those worldviews assume about players and games?
