# English 506 / CSPT 500 (Special Topic): "Media Aesthetics"

**DRAFT DESCRIPTION** 

Media are, like Hermes and Iris, often treated as messengers—as means, containers, and carriers. They are about presence and certainty of communication. *Did you get my message?* They are also about clarity of meaning. *Do you understand it?* This seminar assumes a different approach. We will ask not what media mean or verify, but what they do and, if you're so inclined, what they want. We will examine moments when letters are purloined, signals are noisy, tapes rot, images morph, data degrades, video buffers, software malfunctions . . . when, in short, inefficiency prevails. We will need more than hermeneutics and phenomenology for these examinations. After all, there may be no meaning to reveal and no thing at which to wonder. Instead there will be systems: neither *did you get it* nor *do you understand it*, but rather *how we even communicate*. 

In a systems paradigm, media cannot be isolated as forms (such as text), modalities (such as seeing), frames (such as paper), substances (such as ink), settings (such as libraries), infrastructures (such as publishing), practices (such as writing), or messengers (such as storytellers). They are assemblages of ephemeral techniques made durable through the organization of matter and repetition. The problem is that our experiences of them are mostly economical. Media must add up, like data; they must produce value. *Am I on brand?* As a response to this situation, this seminar proposes media aesthetics. Following Immanuel Kant and Steven Shaviro, aesthetic judgments of media are disinterested (indifferent to use) and non-cognitive (not generalizable as concepts). They are felt and fleeting: occurring within systems without becoming components of them. They are also speculative: without motive to prove the existence or economic worth of a given experience. And they are certainly political: encouraging reflection, cultivation, and even self-alteration against the discipline of the market. My hope is that, through a consideration of media aesthetics, we will not only better understand histories of techniques made durable but also articulate how to make time and space today for the inefficiencies of aesthetic judgments. 

We will study some, but not all, of the following techniques: anachronism (Ishmael Reed), blank space (Stéphane Mallarmé), collage (Mina Loy), defamiliarization (Viktor Shklovsky), détournement (Guy Debord), diary (Phoebe Gloeckner), disintegration (Robert Smithson), epigraph (W.E.B. Du Bois), esolangs (Keymaker), generative systems (Sonia Landy Sheridan), glitching (Jodi), granular synthesis (Iannis Xenakis), hypertext (Judy Malloy), looping (Pamela Z), machinima (Skawennati), montage (Hito Steyerl), mourning blocks (Laurence Sterne), protocols (Postcommodity), prototyping (Brendan Keogh), ratiocination (Edgar Allan Poe), redaction (Jenny Holzer), reflection (Maya Lin), repetition (Laurie Anderson), reverb (King Tubby), scratching (Grand Wizzard Theodore), selfies (Alison Bechdel), slideshows (Nan Goldin), soundwalks (Christine Sun Kim), superimposition (Maya Deren), and zine-making (Nathalie Lawhead). Our studies will combine these techniques with criticism. We will avoid treating the techniques as objects and the criticism as authoritative; rather, we will focus on the apparatuses that entwine creative and critical work.

Near the middle of the term, you will choose a technique that interests you and produce an annotated bibliography (15%) of publications relevant to it. You will then articulate a genealogy (20%) of the technique, identifying stress points in its permutation over time. Finally, you will compose an argument about the technique and its relation to media aesthetics and inefficiency. Here, I will ask you to write with (and not just about) media. You will present your argument as an end-of-term talk (20%) that will become a seminar paper or project (35%). I will also ask you to co-facilitate (10%) one seminar meeting with me. By the term's end, you should be familiar with various frameworks for media studies and also quite knowledgeable about the politics and aesthetics of a particular technique.
