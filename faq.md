## What Do I Need to Purchase? 

Please purchase *Fun Home*. It should be at the UVic Bookstore. 

I recommend purchasing *My Favorite Thing Is Monsters* (also at the Bookstore) and *Fifth Season*; however, I'll provide selections of them for study. I also recommend getting *Undertale* and *Gone Home*, but you could either play with friends or watch gameplay videos.  

I'll point you to the rest of the works.

## What's Media Aesthetics? 

Media aesthetics is the practice of evaluating how design and content are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced. It takes seriously the combination of sensation with understanding, or *sense with making sense*.

## What's an Apparatus? 

Coming soon.

Coming soon. 

## Who Are You?
