As of 19 March 2020, here's our plan for moving forward with "Media Aesthetics." Thanks for your patience and flexibility, everyone. 
REDISTRIBUTION OF ASSIGNMENT WEIGHT

I propose the following redistribution of assignments and their weight: 

* Co-facilitations (either 2 or 3): 20% of your final mark (averaged across your two or three marks)
* Annotated bibliography: 20% of your final mark
* Genealogy: 20% of your final mark
* Final project or essay: 40% of your final mark 

I also propose cutting the presentation from the list of assignments.

CO-FACILITATIONS 

I will average your marks for co-facilitations to date; they will comprise 20% of your final mark. I recognize that some of you completed only two co-facilitations. If you did not perform your third co-facilitation and you'd like to propose an alternative (such as written documentation for a workshop, or the expression of your staging and take in writing) to averaging your two current marks, then I'll certainly accept suggestions; however, I'm not expecting you to submit or commit to an alternative. *Two co-facilitations will suffice.*  

GENEAOLOGY 

I will return feedback and marks for your genealogies (20% of your final mark) via email by Monday, March 23rd. 

FINAL PROJECT OR ESSAY 

The final project or essay will be due by email to me by Monday, April 20th, with a draft abstract and three learning outcomes to me (by email) by Wednesday, April 1st. If you cannot email your final project or essay, then feel free to submit it to my department box.

I will return feedback on the abstract and outcomes by Monday, April 6th. This feedback will include the five learning outcomes (two by me, three by you) for your essay / project. I may revise your three proposed learning outcomes for the sake of clarity and consistency across all five.     

I will circulate by Thursday, March 19th a revised prompt for the final project or essay. It will be more or less identical to the current one: 1) 2500-4000 words (plus notes and references) or the equivalent across media (audio, image, text); 2) 250-word abstract or project description; 3) identification of a venue for the project; and 4) five learning outcomes, three of which you should draft. 

TIMELINE IN BRIEF 

* By March 19th: Revised prompt for the final project / essay to you
* By March 23rd: Genealogy feedback + mark to you 
* By April 1st: Submit draft abstract (250 words) to me
* By April 1st: Submit three draft learning outcomes to me
* By April 6th: Abstract feedback + five learning outcomes to you
* By April 20th: Submit final project / essay to me 

I'm willing to adjust in advance each of these dates. Just email me your requests. Ideally, the final projects / essays are submitted no later than April 24th. You can of course submit them much earlier, at any point between now and April 24th. 

CONTACTING ME 

I'll be available by email and phone (by appointment) between now and late April, and I'm happy to chat with you.  

Thank you for your patience, everyone. This situation is a new experience for me, as I imagine it's new to you. I'll favour compassion in each instance, and for now I want to ensure the above proposal is equitable. Much appreciated. 

Please don't hesitate to email me or make an appointment to discuss your concerns, research, timeline, or the like. I'm around to help. 

All the best, 
Jentery
